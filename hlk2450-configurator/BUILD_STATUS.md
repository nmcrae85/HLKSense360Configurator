# Build Status & Next Steps

## Current Status
✅ GitHub Actions workflow is running
✅ Building for amd64 architecture
✅ Using version 1.0.4 with test server

## What's Happening
1. GitHub is building your Docker image with the test server
2. This will help diagnose why ingress isn't working
3. The test server will show if Home Assistant can reach your add-on

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Build Completion
- Check GitHub Actions tab for all architectures to complete
- This typically takes 5-15 minutes
- Look for green checkmarks on all builds

### 2. In Home Assistant
Once builds are complete:

1. **Remove old version**:
   ```
   Settings → Add-ons → HLK2450 Configurator → Stop → Uninstall
   ```

2. **Force refresh**:
   ```
   Settings → Add-ons → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Reload
   ```

3. **Reinstall**:
   - Search for "HLK2450"
   - Install version 1.0.4
   - Start the add-on

### 3. Check Add-on Logs
Look for these messages:
```
Starting HLK2450 Configurator...
Environment:
  NODE_ENV=production
  PORT=5000
Test server listening on 0.0.0.0:5000
```

### 4. Test Ingress
Try accessing:
```
http://[YOUR_HA_IP]:8123/hassio/ingress/f5b8b369_hlk2450-configurator/
```

## Expected Result with Test Server
You should see:
- "HLK2450 Test Server Running!" heading
- Request info showing the ingress path
- All HTTP headers

## If Still Blank Screen
1. Check add-on logs for errors
2. Try the health endpoint:
   ```
   http://[YOUR_HA_IP]:8123/hassio/ingress/f5b8b369_hlk2450-configurator/health
   ```
3. Share the add-on logs from Home Assistant

The test server is very simple and should work if ingress is configured correctly!
