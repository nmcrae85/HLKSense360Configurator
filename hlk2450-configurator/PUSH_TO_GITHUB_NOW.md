# Push to GitHub NOW - Version 1.0.10

## Current Status
✅ Dockerfile is FIXED locally - no client/public line exists
✅ Version bumped to 1.0.10
✅ Changelog updated

## The Problem
GitHub Actions is using an OLD cached version of the Dockerfile that still has:
```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/client/public /app/public  # THIS LINE IS REMOVED
```

## Solution - Push These Changes
```bash
# 1. Verify the fix is applied locally
cd hlk2450-configurator
grep -n "client/public" Dockerfile
# Should return nothing - the line is removed

# 2. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: remove non-existent client/public directory (v1.0.10)"
git push origin main

# 3. Force GitHub Actions to use new version
# The push will trigger a new build with the updated Dockerfile
```

## What's Fixed in v1.0.10
1. Removed `COPY --from=builder /app/client/public /app/public`
2. Public assets are already in dist/public from vite build
3. Only copying dist folder which contains everything needed

## Expected Result
- Build will succeed without "client/public not found" error
- Docker image will be pushed with tag 1.0.10
- Add-on will be ready for installation
