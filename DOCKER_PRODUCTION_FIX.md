# Docker Production Build Fix Summary

## Issue:
The Docker container was failing with `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite'` because the production build was trying to import Vite, which is a development dependency.

## Solution:
1. Created a separate `logger.ts` file to extract the logging functionality
2. Modified `server/index.ts` to:
   - Import the logger function from the new file
   - Use dynamic import for Vite only in development mode
   - Handle static file serving manually in production

## Changes Made:
- Created `server/logger.ts` and `hlk2450-configurator/server/logger.ts`
- Updated both `server/index.ts` files to conditionally import Vite
- Fixed production static file serving to use Express.static

## Result:
The production Docker build should now work correctly without requiring Vite as a production dependency. The app will serve the built client files from the `client/dist` directory in production mode.
