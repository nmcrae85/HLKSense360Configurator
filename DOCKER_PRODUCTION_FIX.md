# ✅ DOCKER PRODUCTION BUILD FIXED

## What Was Fixed:
- **Removed __dirname** - ES modules don't support __dirname
- **Simplified paths** - Now checks only valid Docker/local paths
- **Tested locally** - Production server now starts without errors

## GitHub Actions Build Status:
Looking at your attached build log, GitHub Actions is successfully building your images:
- ✅ Build process started
- ✅ Multi-architecture support configured
- ✅ Using correct repository: nmcrae85/HLKSense360Configurator

## Next Steps:

### 1. Commit and Push the Fix:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Remove __dirname from ES module production build"
git push
```

### 2. Monitor GitHub Actions:
Go to: https://github.com/nmcrae85/HLKSense360Configurator/actions
- Wait for build to complete (all green checkmarks)
- Should take 5-10 minutes

### 3. Force Home Assistant to Use New Images:
```bash
# SSH into Home Assistant
docker images | grep hlk2450
docker rmi -f [image IDs]  # Force remove old images

# In HA UI:
# 1. Uninstall add-on
# 2. Supervisor → Add-on Store → ⋮ → Reload
# 3. Install fresh
```

## Why This Will Work Now:
1. **No more ES module errors** - Removed incompatible __dirname
2. **Proper path resolution** - Uses process.cwd() for Docker compatibility
3. **Tested production build** - Runs without errors locally

The production server is now ES module compliant and will work in your Docker containers!
