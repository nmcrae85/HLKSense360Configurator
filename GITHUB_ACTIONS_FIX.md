# GitHub Actions Build Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed: Production Build Vite Import Error

### Problem:
The Docker container was failing with `Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'vite'` because the production build was importing Vite, which is only a development dependency.

### Solution Implemented:

1. **Created Production-Specific Entry Point**
   - Created `server/index.production.ts` without any Vite imports
   - This file handles production serving of static files directly

2. **Updated Build Process**
   - Modified `package.json` to build from `index.production.ts`
   - Changed start script to use `index.production.js`

3. **Version Bump**
   - Updated to version 1.0.1 in `config.yaml`
   - Created `CHANGELOG.md` with detailed changes

### Files Changed:
- `hlk2450-configurator/server/index.production.ts` (new)
- `hlk2450-configurator/server/logger.ts` (new)
- `hlk2450-configurator/package.json` (updated scripts)
- `hlk2450-configurator/config.yaml` (version bump)
- `hlk2450-configurator/CHANGELOG.md` (new)

### Result:
✅ Production build no longer imports Vite
✅ Docker container will start successfully
✅ All production dependencies are properly handled

## Next Steps:
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions will automatically build new Docker images
3. In Home Assistant, uninstall and reinstall the add-on to get the fixed version
